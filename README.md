some slight changes.. instead of events and gallery... make it an "about the gallery" page....and a "news/events" page.. if you can have the news page similar to this http://www.gagosian.com/news
that will be great.. please let me know ..i hope im being clear..

for the media page... you can keep the layout simple as well .. maybe like this: http://welancoragallery.com/artist/anders-bernard-jones#

with the ability to add video and images... you can have free range with the layout as long as it is simple and minimal like the theme.. and also the ability to update easily..as the other pages

on the menu between "exhibition" and "store" ..will add "events" and "media" .... the layout for the "events" page.. will be the same layout as "exhibition" page ... will you be able to show me how to add a menu and page? im not familiar with Drupal ..only wordpress so far ... Drupal is more challenging than i imagined
